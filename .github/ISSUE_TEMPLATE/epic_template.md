## Epic Owner To-Do - Delete after completion
When this point has been reached, the idea or functionality has already gotten a green light for planning. These next steps have to be checked before the epic can be given to developers for final specifications and time-boxing. 

- [ ] The epic has a clear goal/name which the user stories accomplish
- [ ] If you feel the Epic requires a description, a short description has been written
- [ ] User happy paths have been written down
- [ ] User stories, which fulfil the user happy paths, have been added to the task list

**When this list is complete:** 

- If you still feel unsure about the epic, ask a coworker to read the whole thing through for feedback. 
- Otherwise, delete this section. The epic is now ready for developers.

## Short description
Write in less than 10 lines what this epic/feature is about. (OPTIONAL)

## User happy paths: 
Write every scenario that the user might encounter with this epic/feature. 
For example:

**AD HOC meeting:**
1. As a user I arrive at the rooms display
2. I press "30 minutes"
3. The display books a meeting for the next 30 minutes

## Timebox
If you are unable to give a time estimate, add a [Spike] issue to the Tasklist. 
Use it to get the necessary context to estimate the job at hand.
```[tasklist]
### User Stories
