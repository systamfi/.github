## Description
Brief summary of what this spike is, reason and context. Create spike solutions to figure out answers 
to tough technical or design problems. Technical spikes are used to research various technical approaches 
in the solution domain. 

For example:

- Evaluate the potential performance or load impact of a new user story
- Evaluate specific implementation technologies that can be applied to a solution
- Develop confidence about a desired approach

Example: 
Based on the idea that when faced with a question, data is better than speculation: so perform a small, 
technical experiment to give you more info. This is a spike.

## Goals
What are the goals of this spike?

## Planning

Outline a proposed plan of how this spike can be undertaken.

## Timebox

Agree on a timebox. The timebox can vary from hours to days based on the scope of the investigation. 
It normally falls within the bounds of an iteration. Discuss undertaking another spike if the timebox doesn't provide enough time to address the criteria.
